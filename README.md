The graph coloring problem takes in a graph and asks what is the fewest
number of colors you could use to color the graph vertices so that no adjacent
vertices are the same color. For example, the graph below requires a minimum
of 4 colors to produce a valid coloring (sample coloring on right):

Graph coloring is useful in scheduling, as well as register assignment in compilers (vertices are variables, edges connect variables active at the same time,
and colors are registers) and other applications.
The greedy coloring algorithm uses colors numbered 1 to n. It iterates
through vertices of the graph in order of vertex ID and assigns each vertex the
minimum color that is not already assigned to one of its neighbors. The return
value is just the largest color assigned to a vertex.
For example, if the graph above had vertex IDs numbered from top to bottom, the algorithm would operate as follows and return 4:
1
Vertex N(v) Color
# colors assigned
1 none 1 (blue)
2 1 2 (green)
3 1, 2 3 (yellow)
4 1, 2, 3 4 (red)
5 1, 2, 4 3 (yellow)
6 3 1 (blue)
7 1, 3 2 (green)
Prove that the greedy algorithm is not correct.
